# VIE_course_d0749e_group_2
Group 2 project repository for VIE course.

We will be using GOLANG to (attempt to) make a 2d graphics board game engine for games such as chess and checkers.

For development, we choose to use Issues and milestones on github as this is easy to use and clearly shows work done by group members.

Documentation will be found in the repository, in the readme and further in the documentation folder (WIP).
